# Ekstraklasa Data Analysis

This project analyzes match data from the **Polish Ekstraklasa** (top football league in Poland) using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.  
The dataset (`POL.xlsx`) contains match-level data such as teams, goals, results, dates, and betting odds.  
The analysis produces summary statistics, visualizations, and reports.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `projekt.ipynb` â€” main Jupyter Notebook with all code, analysis, and visualizations.  
- `POL.xlsx` â€” raw dataset with match results and betting odds.  
- `figures/` â€” folder with all generated plots (PNG).  
- `exports/` â€” folder with exported CSV tables and results.  
- `report.md` / `report.html` â€” auto-generated report with insights and plots.  
- `ekstraklasa_extras.py` â€” extra functions for Elo ratings, Poisson model, head-to-head heatmaps, and rolling form.

## âš½ Data Description

Each row in `POL.xlsx` represents a single match and typically includes:

- `Date` â€” match date  
- `Season` â€” season (e.g. 2021/2022)  
- `HomeTeam`, `AwayTeam` â€” team names  
- `FTHG`, `FTAG` â€” full-time home and away goals  
- `FTR` â€” full-time result (`H`, `D`, `A`)  
- `PSCH`, `PSCD`, `PSCA` â€” betting odds for home, draw, away  

Derived variables:
- `TotalGoals` = `FTHG + FTAG`  
- Probabilities implied from odds (`pH`, `pD`, `pA`)

## ðŸ“Š Analyses & Visualizations

The notebook generates multiple insights and plots:

1. **Average goals per season** â€” line chart.  
2. **Match outcomes (H/D/A) shares per season** â€” bar chart.  
3. **Histogram of total match goals** â€” goal distribution.  
4. **Over 1.5 / Over 2.5 goals trend** â€” seasonal proportions.  
5. **Points table and title race** â€” cumulative points race for top 4 teams.  
6. **Home vs Away goals by team** â€” grouped bar chart.  
7. **Kickoff time distribution** â€” most common match hours.  
8. **Rolling team form** â€” moving averages of points and goals.  
9. **Elo ratings** â€” rating progression over time for selected teams.  
10. **Head-to-Head heatmaps** â€” goal differences between teams in a season.  
11. **Betting odds calibration** â€” reliability plots for H/D/A outcomes.  
12. **Scatter: implied p(H) vs goal difference** â€” how well odds reflect match dominance.

## ðŸ“ˆ Methods

- **Descriptive statistics** with `pandas`  
- **Visualizations** with `matplotlib`  
- **Elo rating system** for team strength over time  
- **Poisson model** for expected goals and win/draw probabilities  
- **Betting market calibration** via Brier score and calibration plots
